# Version 3.0.0, released 2020-03-18

- [Commit 8727521](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/8727521): Large set of changes, primarily to resource names

The listed commit causes lots of breaking changes, but these were expected, and almost all are due to resource name changes.
The logging API is primarily used from integration points, so probably doesn't affect much user code.

Other changes are all just dependencies and implementation details.
