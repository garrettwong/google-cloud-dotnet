* `SimplePublisher` is now named [PublisherClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherClient.yml)
* `SimpleSubscriber` is now named [SubscriberClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.SubscriberClient.yml)
* `PublisherClient` is now named [PublisherServiceApiClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherServiceApiClient.yml)

# Getting started

[PublisherServiceApiClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherServiceApiClient.yml) and
[SubscriberServiceApiClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.SubscriberServiceApiClient.yml)
provide a general-purpose abstraction over raw the RPC API, providing
features such as page streaming to make client code cleaner and
simpler.

[PublisherClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherClient.yml) and [SubscriberClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.SubscriberClient.yml) provide simpler APIs for message publishing and subscribing. These classes offer considerably higher performance and simplicity, especially when working with higher message throughput.

Note that both `PublisherClient` and `SubscriberClient` expect to
execute in an environment with continuous processing and continuous
network access to the Pub/Sub API. In environments such as Cloud Run
or Cloud Functions, where servers do not use any CPU between requests,
the `PublisherServiceApiClient` and `SubscriberServiceApiClient` classes
should be used instead.

# Sample code

Using [PublisherClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherClient.yml) and [SubscriberClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.SubscriberClient.yml) for message publishing and subscribing:

Using [PublisherServiceApiClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.PublisherServiceApiClient.yml) and
[SubscriberServiceApiClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1.SubscriberServiceApiClient.yml) only:
