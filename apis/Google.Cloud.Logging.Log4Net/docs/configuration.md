# Configuration

## Example use in a console app

Create an appender with the following XML configuration:

[!code-xml[](obj/snippets/Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender.txt#log4net_template)]

Save this as `log4net.xml` in your application directory.
Then load it during program startup:

```csharp
using log4net;
using log4net.Config;

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    XmlConfigurator.Configure(new FileInfo("log4net.xml"));
}
```

Logged items will now be sent to Google Cloud Logging:

```csharp
using log4net;

ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Program));
log.Info("An exciting log entry!");
```

## Custom configuration

Within a `GoogleStackdriverAppender` the following options are
available (see also [the GoogleStackdriverAppender reference documentation](api/Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender.html#properties)
for more details):

### projectId

```xml
<projectId value="<your project ID>"/>
```

Optional when running on Google App Engine (GAE) or Google Compute Engine (GCE), must be present on other platforms. The project ID given must be the ID of a project that already exists on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

On GCE and GAE the project ID will be auto-detected from the platform.

### logId

```xml
<logId value="<your log ID>"/>
```

Must be present. The log ID given is any string that is recorded as the name of the log, which can be used for simple filtering when viewing log entries.

### withMetaData

```xml
<withMetaData value="<various, see below>"/>
```

By default no extra metadata is logged. `withMetaData` specifies which extra metadata to log with each log entry, and can be specified multiple times to enable multiple type of metadata:

 * `Location`: The class name, file name, and line number of the log call.
 * `Identity`: The identity of the current thread principle.
 * `ThreadName`: The name of the thread that performed the log call.
 * `UserName`: The name of the current user.
 * `Domain`: The AppDomain friendly name.
 * `LoggerName`: The name of the log4net logger that created this log entry.
 * `Label`: The name of the log4net logging level that caused this log entry (e.g. "FATAL")

### customLabel

```xml
<customLabel>
  <key value="<your key>" />
  <value value="<your value>" />
</customLabel>
```
Allows custom labels to be added to the metadata of log entries.

### UsePatternWithinCustomLabels

```xml
<usePatternWithinCustomLabels value="true"/>
```

Defaults to `false`. Setting this to `true` enables `PatternLayout` use in custom labels.
All the standard patterns documented for Log4Net `PatternLayout` are available.
Custom pattern conversions are not possible.

### resourceType

```xml
<resourceType value="<your resource type>"/>
```

Allows the [Monitored resources](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/MonitoredResource) resource type to be specified; must be set to an entry on the [Monitored Resource List](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/v2/resource-list).

If unset, the default value depends on the detected platform:

* `gae_app` on Google App Engine (GAE).
* `gce_instance` on Google Compute Engine (GCE).
* `global` on all other platforms.

(See [MonitoredResourceBuilder.cs](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-dotnet/blob/master/src/Google.Api.Gax.Grpc/MonitoredResourceBuilder.cs) for details)

### resourceLabel

```xml
<resourceLabel>
  <key value="<key>" />
  <value value="<value>" />
</resourceLabel>
```

If `resourceType` has been manually set, then `resourceLabel` is used to specify extra labels as shown in the [Monitoring Resource Types](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/v2/resource-list#resource-types) list.

### DisableResourceTypeDetection

```xml
<disableResourceTypeDetection value="true">
```

Defaults to `false`. Setting this to `true` disables automatic `resourceType` setting based on platform detection.

### Complete configuration example

So, for example, a complete configuration might look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<log4net>
  <appender name="CloudLogger" type="Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender,Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net">
    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
      <conversionPattern value="%-4timestamp [%thread] %-5level %logger %ndc - %message" />
    </layout>
    <projectId value="myProject" />
    <logId value="myLog" />
    <withMetaData value="Location" />
    <withMetaData value="ThreadName" />
  </appender>
</log4net>
```
### Configuration example: Translating Log4Net properties to Google Cloud Logging labels

If you wanted to transalate Log4Net properties to Google Cloud Logging labels, you can do as follows:

Create a `log4net` configuration file (`log4net.xml`):

[!code-xml[](obj/snippets/Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender.txt#log4net_custom_labels_template)]

Edit the file replacing `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud Project
ID, and `LOG_ID` with an identifier for your application.

Use this file to configure `log4net` and then set Log4Net properties per scopes and log as normal.
If a property referenced in a custom label doesn't have a value for a given entry, the value will be
`(null)`.

{{sample:GoogleStackdriverAppender.Custom_Labels}}

If executing on [Google App Engine (GAE)](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/),
or [Google Compute Engine (GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/),
then the `<projectId value="PROJECT_ID" />` configuration setting can be omitted; it will be auto-detected from the platform at run-time.

## Local queuing configuration

All log entries are queued locally before being sent to Google Cloud Logging.
Only in-memory queuing is currently supported. Persistent on-disk queuing is not currently implemented.

The following in-memory options are available:

```xml
<MaxMemorySize value="<maximum number of bytes to queue>"/>
```

Restricts the amount of memory used for local queuing. If memory is exceeded then the 
oldest log entries will be discarded. A best-effort attempt will be made to log a warning
to Google Cloud Logging that some log messages have been discarded.
A value of 0 means there is no byte limit.

```xml
<MaxMemoryCount value="<maximum count of log messages to queue"/>
```
The maximum count of log messages that be ever be concurrently locally queued. If this
maximum count is exceeded then the oldest log entries will be discarded. A best-effort
attempt will be made to log a warning to Google Cloud Logging that some log messages
have been discarded.
A value of 0 means there is no count limit.

If MaxMemorySize and MaxMemoryCount are both specified, then messages will be discarded
when the first limit is reached.

The default setting is to limit count to 1,000; with no limit on bytes.

## Providing a JSON payload

Log entries in Google Cloud Logging either have a text payload or a
JSON payload. By default, the
`Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender` uses a text
payload. However, you can implement the
[IJsonLayout](api/Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.IJsonLayout.html) interface and configure
the appender to use that. The JSON payload is expressed as a
Protocol Buffers `Struct` message. If the `IJsonLayout.Format`
method returns null from your layout, the appender will create a
text payload as normal.

For example, here's a sample JSON layout implementation that
demonstrates creating a payload with a mixture of values from
execution time (the event message and exception) and from
configuration (the "SampleConfiguration" value).

{{sample:GoogleStackdriverAppender.IJsonLayout}}

You would then configure the appender in XML like this:

```xml
<appender name="CloudLogger" type="Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net.GoogleStackdriverAppender,Google.Cloud.Logging.Log4Net">
  <!-- The IJsonLayout implementation used to create JSON payloads -->  
  <jsonLayout type="YourNamespace.SampleJsonLayout,YourAssemblyName">
    <sampleConfigurationValue value="10" />
  </jsonLayout>

  <!-- 
    - Other configuration as normal. The textlayout is used if the
    -  JSON layout returns null.
    -->
  
  <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
    <conversionPattern value="%-4timestamp [%thread] %-5level %logger %ndc - %message" />
  </layout>
  <projectId value="PROJECT_ID" />
  <logId value="LOG_ID" />
</appender>
```
