# Version 2.0.0-beta02, released 2020-03-18

- [Commit 1d8b26a](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/1d8b26a):

  - methods.

# Version 2.0.0-beta01, released 2020-02-18	

This is the first prerelease targeting GAX v3. Please see the [breaking changes	
guide](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-dotnet/docs/guides/breaking-gax2.html)	
for details of changes to both GAX and code generation.	

Some methods that previously accepted resource names now do not, due	
to a change in how the resource names in the API are configured.

# Version 1.0.0, released 2019-07-16	

- [Commit 50658e2](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/50658e2):	
  - Regenerate all APIs with resource name format methods

- [Commit 215ea7f](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/215ea7f):

  - This uses the new GAX method for the routing header, which URL-encodes values.	
- [Commit 5d34517](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/5d34517):	
  - Regenerate all APIs	
  - Changes here are due to changes in protoc and the gRPC plugin for protoc, and should be backwardly compatible.

  - Fixes [issue 2442](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/issues/2442).	

# Version 1.0.0-beta20, released 2019-04-17	

- [Commit 759e007](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/759e007):	
  - Regenerate Firestore V1	
  - This change from string to AnyPathName is currently a breaking change, but won't be in the new generator. Fortunately we haven't gone GA yet.	
- [Commit 673ef14](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/673ef14): Regenerate Firestore	
- [Commit a1a01f9](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/a1a01f9):

- [Commit 52417d1](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/52417d1): Regenerate Firestore V1 - comment typo fix	
- [Commit 79700f7](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/79700f7): Regenerate Firestore API: comment changes only	

# Version 1.0.0-beta19, released 2019-02-07	

- [Commit 7a50886](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/7a50886):	
  - Retry BatchGetDocuments RPC within GetDocumentSnapshotsAsync	
  - This effectively treats the streaming API as if it were a unary API. We may be able to remove some of the redundancy between this and GAX in the future.	
  - We *only* apply this to GetDocumentSnapshotsAsync - when streaming query results, we can't retry transparently as the caller can see some results before the failure.	
  - The use of FirestoreClient.Settings doesn't play nicely with mocking. It would be nice to be able to say "You can call Settings as often as you like, but make sure no other unexpected calls are made" but I haven't been able to achieve that. It's not a big problem though.	
  - Fixes [issue 2760](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/issues/2760)	

# Version 1.0.0-beta18, released 2019-02-05

# Version 1.0.0-beta16, released 2019-01-15	

- [Commit 667d724](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/667d724): Add resource routing to Firestore.V1 client	
- [Commit af8063e](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/af8063e):	
  - Generate Firestore v1 API	
  - This replaces the V1Beta1 API (the YAML file only contains the V1 definition).	
  - After migrating to V1 entirely, we'll delete the V1Beta1 directory.
