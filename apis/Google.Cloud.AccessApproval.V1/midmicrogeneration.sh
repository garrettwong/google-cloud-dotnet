# Rename the AccessApproval service to AccessApprovalService.
# This avoids naming collisions with AccessApprovalSettings, which
# is both a message type in the protos and the settings class we
# would otherwise generate for the service.
#
# It's not great to have to do this, but there are no nice alternatives.
