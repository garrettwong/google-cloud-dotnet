This isn't a real API, but a "service directory" of information
summarizing https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis in a JSON file.
By including it in apis/ with a synth.py file, we can get it
regenerated regularly by autosynth.

This is expected to be a temporary solution, until we have a more
centralized place to put the file.
