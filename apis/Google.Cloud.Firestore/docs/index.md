# Getting started

Everything starts with [FirestoreDb](obj/api/Google.Cloud.Firestore.FirestoreDb.yml).
Create an instance using the `Create` or `CreateAsync` methods, passing in your Google Cloud project ID.
The default credentials will be used to authenticate with the
server. `FirestoreDb` is thread-safe, and we recommend using a
single instance across your application where possible.

From there, you can create, fetch and modify documents, and run queries.

For customization of credentials and other settings, create a
`FirestoreDbBuilder`, set the appropriate properties, and call
`Build` to create a `FirestoreDb`.

# Connecting to the emulator

To connect to the [Firestore
Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators/firestore/),
you need to:

- Connect to the emulator endpoint
- Use `ChannelCredentials.Insecure` as the channel credentials
- Specify an "Authorization: Bearer owner" header on each request

As of version 1.1.0-beta02, the library has support for detecting
the emulator via the environment variable and connecting to it
automatically, if requested. This is configured via
`FirestoreDbBuilder`, which can also be used to configure custom
credentials easily.

The following code creates a `FirestoreDb` which will use the
emulator when the environment variables are present, but will
otherwise connect to the production environment.

[EmulatorDetection property](obj/api/Google.Cloud.Firestore.FirestoreDbBuilder.yml#Google_Cloud_Firestore_FirestoreDbBuilder_EmulatorDetection)
for more details.
