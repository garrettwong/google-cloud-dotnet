# Processes, release procedures etc

This repository includes multiple projects at multiple versions,
some of which depend on each other. That makes things tricky, and
leads to rather more complicated procedures than a simple "single
package" repository. Please read this guide carefully to understand
how releases happen, and why they happen that way.

## The API catalog

Only the source within the `apis` directory is published, although not
every project within that directory is published.
(There are test projects and tools alongside the production code.)
Nothing in the `tools` directory is published as a package.

Most project files under `apis` are at least partially generated.
Metadata used for generation is in [apis.json](apis/apis.json) - the API
catalog file. There's an entry for each API, containing:

- The kind of API (grpc, rest, other)
- The version number
- A product title and home page for documentation
- Dependencies
- Additional test project dependencies
- Target framework versions
- Package description for NuGet
- Tags for NuGet (in addition to default ones)
- Proto path within the googleapis repository
- Service YAML file

The catalog is used to generate project files and also during the
release process described below. Running the project generator is
very simple: from the root directory, in a bash shell, run

```bash
./generateprojects.sh
```

The CI systems run this before building, to ensure that the project
files are in a stable state.

Generating the project files allows for broad changes (such as
adding Source Link support) to be made very simply, just by changing
the generator. Modifying every project file by hand simply doesn't
scale.

However, sometimes manual editing of project files is required. The
project generator supports this by assuming it "owns":

- The first `PropertyGroup` element (for general properties)
- The first `ItemGroup` element (for dependencies)
- The `ItemGroup` element for Source Link (with a label of "dotnet pack instructions")
- The common import to only attempt to build desktop assemblies on Windows

Any other elements are left as they are - so if you wish to add an
`ItemGroup` such as for file grouping, just add it anywhere after
the generated one, and it should do the right thing.

Additionally, for each API, the project generator adds all projects
under the API directory (and project references) to the solution for
that API. It will create project files from scratch as well - so when adding a
new package from autogenerated API sources, the simplest approach is
to copy the source files, modify the API catalog, and run the
project generator. The project files and solution file will be
generated and should immediately be usable.

## Versioning

All releasable packages follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
Non-releasable code (tests, tools, analyzers) are not versioned. The
precise meaning of a breaking change (dictating version number
increments) is out of the scope of this document. (Jon is writing a
blog post about this topic and will link to it when it is published.)

The version number in the API catalog (and therefore in project
files) is one of:

- The mostly recently released package version
- The version that's *about* to be released (see below)
- A prerelease with a suffix of 00 to indicate that the *next* release
  should be the first prerelease for that major/minor version.

The last of these cases can happen if either an existing version has
gone to GA and new features have been merged since (to ensure that
we don't add features within a minor GA version) or for brand-new
APIs that haven't been released at all. The tooling for tagging is
aware of this convention, and doesn't create tags for `alpha00` or
`beta00` suffixes.

Typically version numbers should be changed in a commit which does
nothing else, for clarity. Include both the `apis.json` change and
the project file changes that occur when the project generator has
been run, in the same commit.

### Dependencies

Dependencies in the API catalog are specified as properties where
the property name is the package name and the value is the version
number.

If the version number is set to "project", then a project reference
is used. If project X has a production dependency on project Y, then
both X and Y *must* be released together, to avoid misaligned
versions. The tagging tool enforces this.

If the version number is set to "default", then the version number
is determined by the project generator, to keep these dependencies
in sync for all appropriate packages.

Two project types gain dependencies automatically if they're not
specified:

- "grpc" projects always have dependencies on Google.Api.Gax.Grpc
  and Grpc.Core
- "rest" projects always have a dependency on Google.Api.Gax.Rest

The best dependency version to specify depends on the version of the
project itself:

- For GA versions, every version must be explicitly specified. This
  prevents us from accidentally upgrading a dependency minor version
  when creating a patch version of the project itself.
- For alpha/beta versions, specify as little as possible: allow
  the "grpc"/"rest" dependencies above to be added automatically,
  and use the "default" version number where possible. Explicit
  versions should only be used either for dependencies without
  default versions, or when the desired version is ahead of the
  default version, for example to use a GAX prerelease.

## Releasing

Releasing consists of these steps:

- Updating the version number in GitHub (via standard pull requests),
  as well as the version history.
- Creating a release tag and GitHub release
- Building and testing
- Pushing the package to nuget.org
- Updating the documentation in GitHub (in the `gh-pages` branch)

The last three of these are typically performed by a Kokoro release
job.

### Detailed steps

Much of this work is automated by the `prepare-release.sh` script,
but allows for intervention at any point. This documentation assumes
the use of `prepare-release.sh`, but that's just for simplicity.
Everything can be done manually.

Note that only the `set-version` command for `prepare-release` needs
the package ID to be specified. All other commands work on the basis
of "whatever versions have been changed since the latest commit on
GitHub are the ones we want to release".

**Create the release PR**

1. Make sure the `master` branch is up-to-date (as that's what
`prepare-release.sh` uses to determine the current versions)
and create a new branch from that. If you want to use the `compare`
option later, run `git fetch --all --tags -f` as well to make sure
you have all the latest tags.

2. Run `./prepare-release.sh set-version <api> <new-version>`, e.g.
`prepare-release.sh set-version Google.Cloud.Speech.V1 2.0.0-beta03`. This
updates `apis.json` and regenerates the project and metadata files.
The output includes the old version and the new version, so you can
check this is really what you meant to do.

    As an alternative to `set-version`, you can run
    `./prepare-release.sh increment-version <api>` which will increment
    the minor version for GA libraries (e.g. 3.1.0 to 3.2.0) or the
    prerelease version of non-GA libraries (e.g. 3.0.0-beta01 to 3.0.0-beta02).
    This just avoids you having to look up the current version number
    if you don't already know it. If you want to look up the version
    number anyway, use `./prepare-release.sh show-version <api>`.

3. If you want to perform an API surface comparison,
run `./prepare-release.sh compare`. This will build the code
locally, and compare the previously released NuGet packages with the
current source code, showing you what's changed. Check there's
nothing unexpected. Note that this will only show changes to the API
surface; internal changes (even if they change behavior) will not be
shown.

4. Run `./prepare-release.sh update-history`. This will update the
version history files of all changed APIs, based on the commits
that touched the relevant directories. The command displays any
additions that it makes to the version history, along with the name
of the history file for each API.

5. If you're only releasing a single package, run
`./prepare-release.sh commit`. This will commit all the current
changes, with a message taken from the version history for the
package. Use `git commit --amend` to change the commit message if
you need to.

    If you're releasing more than one package, use
    `./prepare-release.sh commit-multiple <commit title>`, e.g.
    `./prepare-release.sh commit-multiple "Release Spanner libraries version 3.3.0"`.
    Alternatively, create the commit manually, including one line per package of the form
    `- Release XYZ version ABC`.

6. Run `./prepare-release.sh push` to push the current branch and
create a pull request with the `autorelease: pending` tag. Note that
this checks that there are no project references from
APIs being released now to APIs that *aren't* being released.
Without this check, it's possible for a released version to depend
on unreleased changes. This uses the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variable to authenticate with the API, so make this is
set beforehand. The access token should include the `repo` scope.

Sample session when releasing Google.Cloud.Speech.V1:

```text
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master
$ git fetch --all --tags -f
$ git checkout -b release-speech
$ ./prepare-release.sh set-version Google.Cloud.Speech.V1 2.0.0-beta03
$ ./prepare-release.sh compare
$ ./prepare-release.sh update-history
$ ./prepare-release.sh commit
$ export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
$ ./prepare-release.sh push
```

Equivalent process using `increment-version`, assuming the current
version is 2.0.0-beta02:

```text
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master
$ git fetch --all --tags -f
$ git checkout -b release-speech
$ ./prepare-release.sh increment-version Google.Cloud.Speech.V1
$ ./prepare-release.sh compare
$ ./prepare-release.sh update-history
$ ./prepare-release.sh commit
$ export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
$ ./prepare-release.sh push
```

**Building and publishing the release**

Once the pull request is merged, the commit will be tagged
automatically, and a release will be created. A Kokoro release build
will then execute automatically.

The Kokoro build will:

- Fetch the commit
- See which tags are present for that commit (to work out which packages need releasing)
- For all those packages:
  - Build
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration/snippet tests
  - Build documentation
  - Push packages to nuget.org
  - Push documentation to GitHub packages
  - Push documentation to googelapis.dev
